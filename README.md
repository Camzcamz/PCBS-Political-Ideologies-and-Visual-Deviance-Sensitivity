## AE Project: The Influence of Political Opinion on Visual Deviance Sensitivity ##
Okimoto and Gromet's (2015) findings suggests that conservatives show greater sensitivity to deviance than liberals. Specifically, they reported that conservatives were less likely to characterize an ambiguous triangle (or circle, oval, rectangle, square) as being a triangle (or circle, oval, rectangle, square). After inquiring on the participant’s demographic information and political views they presented a picture stimulus (e.g. ‘ambiguous square’ or a ‘perfect square’) with a Likert scale question (e.g. Is it a square? Scale 1 to 5). 

I replicated the experiment to see if the difference in sensitivity to deviance between conservatives and liberals is also true using other stimuli and if the order of inquiring on political opinion influences sensitivity to deviance. In addition to replicating their finding that shape discrimination differs between groups, I will test if color discrimination differs between groups and if the order of political inquiry influences how people categorize colors or shape as being typical. 

I have contacted the experimenters and obtained their materials (demographic, political questions, and shape stimuli) as well as created new stimuli (color pictures) using pygame.  All images were resized prior to the experiments to be of similar shape. A consent form will be given to the participant before the subject begins the experiment. 

## Research Question: Does political opinion influence how we distinguish deviance? ##
1.	Does political opinion influence how we distinguish deviance in shape? 
*Hypothesis: Yes, it does; based on Okimoto and Gromet (2015) findings.*
2.	Does political opinion influence how we distinguish deviance in colors?
*Hypothesis: If political opinion influences deviance sensitivity, we expect it to generalize to other stimuli than shapes.*
3.	Does political opinion influence how we distinguish deviance in shape or colors only when we are prompt to manifest our political opinions prior to the image deviance judgment task?
*Hypothesis: It may be that political opinion influences deviance sensitivity only when it is consciously brought to mind prior to deviance judgment rather than at all times. This will be the case if there is no difference between groups when they are asked about their political opinion following the task.*
