AE Project: Political Ideologies and Visual Deviance Sensitivity
============================================================================================
## Introduction 

Okimoto and Gromet's (2015) findings suggests that conservatives show greater sensitivity to deviance than liberals. Specifically, they reported that conservatives were less likely to characterize an ambiguous triangle (or circle, oval, rectangle, square) as being a triangle (or circle, oval, rectangle, square). After inquiring on the participant’s demographic information and political views they presented a picture stimulus (e.g. ‘ambiguous square’ or a ‘perfect square’) with a Likert scale question (e.g. Is it a square? Scale 1 to 5). 

I replicated the experiment to see if the difference in sensitivity to deviance between conservatives and liberals is also true using other stimuli and if the order of inquiring on political opinion influences sensitivity to deviance. In addition to replicating their finding that shape discrimination differs between groups, I will test if color discrimination differs between groups and if the order of political inquiry influences how people categorize colors or shape. 

I have contacted the experimenters and obtained their materials (demographic, political questions, and shape stimuli) as well as created new stimuli (color pictures) using pygame.  All images were resized prior to the experiment to be of similar shape. A paper consent form will be given to the participant before the subject begins the experiment. 

## Research Question: Does political opinion influence our sensitivity to deviance? ##
1.	Does political opinion influence how we distinguish deviance in shape? 
*Hypothesis: Yes, it does when political ideologies are asked before the image task, based on Okimoto and Gromet's (2015) findings.*
2.	Does political opinion influence how we distinguish deviance in colors?
*Hypothesis: If political opinion influences deviance sensitivity, we expect it to generalize to other stimuli than shapes.*
3.	Does political opinion influence how we distinguish deviance in shape or colors only when we are prompt to manifest our political opinions prior to the image deviance judgment task?
*Hypothesis: It may be that political opinion influences deviance sensitivity only when it is consciously brought to mind prior to deviance judgment rather than at all times. This will be the case if there is no difference between groups when they are asked about their political opinion following the stimuli (color or shape) judgment task.*

## Stimuli Preparation ##

### Shapes Stimuli 
The first step was obtaining by email and renaming the shape stimuli obtainedby Okimoto and colleagues (2015), which was then stored in the Stimuli folder. 

### Color Stimuli 
The second step was creating the color stimuli with colors chosen from //www.htmlcsscolor.com/hex/00FF6D and using the following script `Colors.py`:

### Rescale Stimuli 

### Experimental Lists 
Task Stimuli List 

Access demographic data for all participants in " demographic.csv " file in Data folder. Access image task data for each participant in Data folder.
